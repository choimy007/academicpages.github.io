I made a simple xkcd-style password generator using Pokemon names.
So far, the only user input it takes is which generations the user wants to draw the names from.

Github Repo
======
<span style="color:blue">[Link](https://github.com/choimy007/pokemon-password)</span>

The code scraps the names from Wikipedia using Beautiful Soup for Python, 
and generates a random sequences of 4 names.

Eventual Todo
======
* Add customization for number of names to generate the password
* Generate random numbers to be part of the password
* Generate special characters to be a part of the password
* Add trainer names?
